# eslint-plugin-freaking

An ESLint plugin to add some freaking rules.

## Current Rules

* no-freaking-tadpoles
    * See [The Tadpole Operators](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150525-00/?p=45044) for details
    * This rule disallows use of the tadpole operators, and suggests suitable alternative uses.
